    * readonly - The readonly mode loads the form with output fields only, and without Submit or Cancel buttons.
    * view - The view mode loads the form using output fields with inline editing enabled, indicated by the edit icons near each field. If the user clicks an edit icon, all fields in the form become editable, and the form displays Submit and Cancel buttons.
    * edit - When a recordId is passed, edit mode loads the form with input fields displaying the specified recordâ€™s field values. The form also displays Submit and Cancel buttons.
* Number of Columns - Integer for number of columns (can only be 1 or 2)
* Header - fill in the value for a header to create a collapisable section that mimics a Salesforce lightning page layout section
